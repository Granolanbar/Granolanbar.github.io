<p> I was born and raised in Orange County, just an hour south from where I currently live in LA. I'm told my personality meshes well with the southern California go with the flow vibes. I enjoy trying new things and taking on new challenges ultimately seeing if I think or swim. </p>

<p> I earned a Bachelor's degree from UCLA in Civil Engineering. I studied Civil Engineering because math and science were my favorite subjects in school and because buildings always fascinated me. </p>

<p> My interest in data started with reading the book <u>Freakonomics</u>. In the book, I found it extremely interesting how if you ask the right, probing questions of your dataset you can find seemingly unintuitive results. I enjoy the challenge and sense of discovery that comes with data science as your work towards exploring new information and potentially solving some of the world's biggest problems. </p>

<p> In my free time, I enjoy attending comedy shows and spending time with friends. I have take a few improvisation classes for fun. I love playing sports and played Lacrosse in High School and at UCLA. Today, I can be found playing soccer on a few different teams. I also have aspirations of owning a mountain bike. </p>

<p> I like to travel. I studied abroad in Barcelona for a summer and traveled around Europe afterwards. I also backpacked through most of the continent of South America with some friends from school post-graduation. For my next trip, I am looking towards Asia. </p>
